## Success Metrics (KPIs to Track)

- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)

### Engagement
- Average devotionals generated per user

- PDF export rate

### Revenue
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Annual recurring revenue (ARR)
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
**Risk:** Gemini API reliability/cost increases
**Mitigation:** Budget $500/month for API costs, have OpenAI as backup

**Risk:** Database costs scale with users
**Mitigation:** Implement pagination, cleanup old devotionals, optimize queries

### Business Risks
**Risk:** Low conversion rate (free → paid)
**Mitigation:** Strong onboarding, clear value prop, limited free tier

**Risk:** High churn after first month
**Mitigation:** Engagement emails, feature adoption tracking, exit surveys

### Market Risks
**Risk:** Churches resistant to AI-generated content
**Mitigation:** Position as "AI-assisted" not "AI-written", human review encouraged

**Risk:** Competitors copy features
**Mitigation:** Focus on UX and brand, move fast, build moat with integrations

- Core features working reliably
- Clean, maintainable codebase

- No marketing site/landing page
- Limited brand recognition
- Single developer (bus factor)

### Opportunities 💰
- Large underserved market (300K+ US churches)
- Low competition in AI-assisted devotional space
- B2B potential (churches pay more than individuals)
- Recurring revenue model (SaaS)
- Network effects (sharing creates awareness)

### Threats ⚠️
- AI content skepticism in religious communities
- Established competitors with loyal users
- Gemini API cost increases
- Church budget constraints
- Regulatory changes (AI content disclosure)

---

## Bottom Line

**Current State**: Production-ready MVP with core features working
**Time to First Dollar**: 2-3 weeks (if prioritizing payment integration)
**Estimated Development to Launch**: 4-6 weeks for full paid product
**Break-even Point**: ~50 paid customers ($600/month MRR)
**Runway Needed**: $5,000-10,000 for development, marketing, initial operations

**Recommendation**: Implement user accounts and Stripe payment in next 2 weeks, launch paid tiers with limited free tier, focus on B2B church market for faster revenue growth.
